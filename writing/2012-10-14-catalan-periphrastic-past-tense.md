In the Catalan language, there are three important periphrastic constructions that can be formed with the auxiliary verb _anar_ (“to go”). One is the _anar + present participle_ construction, which is functionally and formally equivalent to the Spanish _ir_ (“to go”) _+ present participle_ construction. This construction has the same tense as the tense in which the auxiliary _anar_ is conjugated, and has a progressive aspect. Another construction is the _anar a + infinitive_ construction, which is formally equivalent to the Spanish _ir a + infinitive construction_, but has a slightly different function: instead of functioning as a periphrastic future tense, as in Spanish, the Catalan construction carries the same tense as the conjugated _anar_ and has an inchoative aspect. The third periphrastic construction with _anar_ is the one that interests us here: it is formed with a non-standard present tense conjugation of _anar_ followed by the infinitive, and functions as a periphrastic past tense. In this essay, I will provide a brief overview of the characteristics of this construction that make it unusual from a linguistic perspective, and outline Antoni Badia’s argument of the development of the periphrastic past tense.

The periphrastic past tense construction is of interest to us for several reasons. Firstly, the conjugation used is not the standard present tense conjugation of _anar_. _Anar_ in the present tense normally conjugates as follows:

#### 1. Standard present tense conjugation of _anar_

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | vaig | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | anem |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | vas  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | aneu |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | va   |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | van  |

The irregular conjugation is due to syncretism of the Latin verbs _amnare_ and _vadere_ as they evolved into Catalan; an _ir-_ root also appears in the future and conditional conjugations of standard modern Catalan, derived from Latin _ire._ (“anar”, _Diccionari_) This syncretism can also be found in many of the Western Romance languages, such as Spanish and Portuguese _ir_ (syncretism of Latin _ire_, _vadere_ and the perfect forms of _esse_) and Italian _andare_ (syncretism of Latin _amnare_ and _vadere_).

However, when _anar_ is used as part of the periphrastic past tense, it &nbsp;conjugates as follows:

#### 2. Present tense conjugation of _anar_ in periphrastic past tense

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | vaig    | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | **vam** |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | vas     |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | **vau** |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | va      |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | van     |

Besides the non-standard conjugation, this periphrastic construction is also significant because of its function. Other Western Romance languages have a formally similar construction that is functionally distinct. In French, for example, the _aller_ (“to go”) _+ infinitive_ construction is formally equivalent to the Catalan periphrastic past, but this construction in French serves instead as a periphrastic _future_ tense, rather than as a past tense. The same happens in Portuguese with a periphrastic _ir_ (“to go”) _+ infinitive_ future tense construction. As mentioned previously, Spanish has an _ir a + infinitive_ construction that functions as a future tense. Among the major Western Romance languages, Catalan is the only language to form a periphrastic past tense with a present tense form of the auxiliary verb “to go”.

Historically, the preterite form was preferred to the periphrastic form. However, in the written language, the periphrastic past tense now occurs in free variation with the simple past (preterite), and in the spoken language, the periphrastic past tense has virtually replaced the simple past, except in the Balearic Islands, where the simple past continues to be used in speech. Grammars of Catalan are very emphatic in saying that the periphrastic past and the simple past are semantically identical, even if one form may be preferred over the other for stylistic or historical reasons. Antoni Badia, for example, says that “today literary Catalan employs both tenses equally, such that the choice has become a stylistic device… It need not even be said that meaning of the two perfect forms is always identical” (_Gramática Catalana_, 277). Alarcos Llorach, in his _Estudis de Lingüística Catalana_, mentions several times while analyzing the preterite form _portí_ (“I carry”, from _portar,_ “to carry”) that it is equivalent to _vaig portar_ (125, 130, 132).

Another reason the periphrastic past tense construction is of interest to us is that the Catalan periphrastic past tense has undergone formal changes since its first appearance in writing. In the earliest written texts such as the _Libre dels feyts del rey en Jacme_, also known as the _Crònica del Jaume I_ (written in the 13th or 14th century), it appears that the periphrastic past tense might not have been formed with the present tense of _anar_, but with the preterite conjugation. In _Gramàtica Històrica Catalana_, Badia points out that the phrases _van ferir_ (with the auxiliary in the present tense, third person plural) and _anà’l ferir_ (with the auxiliary in the preterite, third person singular) both appear in the _Crònica_. He argues that since the Provençal and Castilian of that era had periphrastic present tense _anar + infinitive_ and _ir + infinitive_ constructions respectively, it seems likely that _van ferir_ was a periphrastic construction for the present tense, and the periphrastic past tense construction could instead have been _anà’l ferir_. (370) This suggests that at some point, while the Spanish and Provençal forms involving the conjugated present tense either fell out of use or, in the case of Spanish, evolved to become a periphrastic future tense, in Catalan the periphrastic construction evolved in the other direction to become a periphrastic past tense. How did this evolution happen in Catalan, given that it did not happen in any other Western Romance language?

Badia has reconstructed, using “traces that are found in the texts”, a possible early form of the conjugation of _anar_ as used in the periphrastic present and past tenses (_Gramàtica Històrica Catalana_ 370):

#### 3. Possible historical present tense conjugation of _anar_

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | vau       | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | **anam**  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | vas       |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | **anats** |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | va /vai   |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | van       |

#### 4. Possible historical preterite conjugation of _anar_

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | aní / ané | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | **anam**  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | anist     |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | **anats** |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | anà       |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | anaren    |

Badia suggests that as the preterite form became replaced by the periphrastic form, the fact that the 1pl and 2pl forms of _anar_ in the present tense and simple past were identical, coupled with the “constant mix of the historical present and the perfect in old texts”, caused the present tense to be substituted for the preterite in the auxiliary verb _anar,_ resulting in a conjugation that corresponds to the one still used in the modern Algherese dialect of Catalan (_Gramática Històrica_ 371):

#### 5. Present tense conjugation of _anar_ in modern Algherese, used in the periphrastic past tense

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | vaig  | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | anam  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | vas   |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | anats |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | va    |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | van   |

Badia postulates that once the periphrastic past tense became a definitive substitute for the simple past tense, Catalan speakers began to treat, for example, _va venir_ (“he came”) as a single unit, almost as if it were a synthetic form of the verb with an inflected prefix (_Gramàtica Històrica_ 371). Thus, he argues that the 1pl and 2pl forms became regularized to _vam_ and _vau_ to match the other conjugated forms, resulting in the modern standard Catalan conjugation of _vaig, vas, va, vam, vau_ and _van_ (_Gramàtica Històrica_ 371). Because the regularization was tied specifically to the use of _anar_ as an auxiliary, this did not affect the standard conjugation, creating the distinction we see today in the two different conjugations of _anar_.

There is an alternative conjugation, used only in the periphrastic _anar + infinitive_ construction, that occurs in free variation in Central Catalan with the conjugation shown above in Table 1:

#### 6. Alternative present tense conjugation of _anar_ in periphrastic past tense

| 1<sup>st</sup> person singular | (1s)  | vàreig | 
| 1<sup>st</sup> person plural   | (1pl) | vàrem  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person singular | (2s)  | vàres  |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural   | (2pl) | vàreu  |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular | (3s)  | va     |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural   | (3pl) | varen  |

The variant forms _vàreig_, _vàres, vàrem, vàreu_ and _varen_, Badia argues, came about because if the present tense 3pl conjugation _van_ were a regular conjugation, this would yield a preterite 3pl conjugation of _varen_, and consequently a _var-_ root propagated into the 1s, 2s, 1pl and 2pl forms with varying degrees of incidence (_Gramàtica Històrica_ 371). This argument seems plausible because if _varen_ were indeed the preterite 3pl form of a verb _var_, the preterite 3s form of the verb would remain _va_ (compare preterite 3s conjugation _cantà_ for the verb _cantar_). Badia also notes that of the _var-_ forms of the verb, the 1s _vàreig_ is the least commonly used, which lines up with his hypothesis of a regularized _var_- form; in this conjugation, _vàreig_ would be an irregular form (compare preterite 1s conjugation _cantí_ for _cantar_) and it makes sense that it occurs less often than the others. (_Gramàtica Històrica_ 371)

There remains much to be studied in the Catalan periphrastic past tense construction. Given that there are two different conjugations for the same periphrasis in free variation, and the periphrastic form itself is still in free variation with the synthetic form of the verb, at least in the written language, it seems likely that a shift towards one form over the other two will eventually occur, although it will be a slow process. Moreover, it would be instructive to study similar processes of verbal periphrasis in closely-related languages, particularly Occitan, to see if there were any unique linguistic characteristics that caused this periphrasis to develop in Catalan but not in any of its neighboring languages.
